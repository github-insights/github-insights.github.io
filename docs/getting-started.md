# Getting Started

To get started pull the latest image from [our package repository](https://github.com/github-insights/github-metrics/pkgs/container/github-metrics)
and after setting the [minimal configuration](configuration/minimal-config.md) 
deploy it on your infrastructure of choice. The application will expose all 
metrics on the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.

## Authentication

To be able to make requests to the Github Api on your behalf Github Metrics uses
[Github Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps). The [`AuthApp Github Metrics`](https://github.com/apps/authapp-github-metrics)
has the correct privileges to only access the nessesary data. To use it simply install it
on your organization and generate a private key which is then used to set the
`APP_GITHUB_APPLICATION_PEM` env variable. 

| environement variable name        | description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| APP_GITHUB_APPLICATION_ID         | The id of the Github App installed for authorizing the Api calls made by Github Metics (In the case of `AuthApp Github Metrics` is: **882159**)|
| APP_GITHUB_APPLICATION_INSTALL_ID | The id of the installation of the above mentioned Github App |
| APP_GITHUB_APPLICATION_PEM        | A private key generated through the installation of the Github App. This environement variable is just the whole `pem` string provided by Github |

Github Metrics will only request the repositories that you give the app the access
to. Any other repositories that are not added in the Apps list will be completly
ignored.

# Grafana - Heinrich
Grafana is a great tool for visualizing time series data so is a perfect solution to display the data generated by this service. We have created some great example dashboards that you can copy from as you wish.

TODO: link public dashboard???? or merely the JSON export
